# testline_assignment

Understanding the given data:

1.XgAgFJ.json this file contains the previos 14 responses of a particular student. (history data)
2.rJvd7g.json this file contains the format of the expected result after the verification of student responses. (required result format)
3.LLQT contains the key for the quiz. (correct answers for validation)

Project overview:
Task_1:
  Developing a solution which takes the generated response sheet (structure similar to one of the entry from XgAgFFJ.json) and the file that contains the key 
  (structure similar to LLQT file) as an input and calculate the result(structure similar to rJvdg.json)

Task_2:
   Analize the previous performance data(XgAgFj.json) and generate the insights from it like average accuarcy for each topic, average score in each topic.Also 
   compare the current performance with the above genertaed result and generate the recomondations.
